Introduction

vxl is a package containing a command-line tool and a python module. These
should be used to communicate with either the bittorrent client Transmission or
transmission-daemon.

Getting started
===============

vxl requires:

	* Transmission 1.22+
	* simplejson >= 1.71

Install

vxl is installed by running setup.py

The setup program will take care of the simplejson requirement. Please refer to
