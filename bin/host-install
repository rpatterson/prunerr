# Host OS packages:
# - `gettext`: We need `$ envsubst` in the `expand_template` `./Makefile` function
# - `py3-pip`: We need `$ pip3` to install the project's Python build tools
# - `docker-cli-compose`: Dependencies for which we can't get current versions otherwise
# - `gnupg`, `github-cli`, `curl`: Needed for publishing releases from CI/CD
