daemon:
  ## The number of seconds to wait between each execution of the order of operations.
  ## Default: 60
  # poll: 60
servarrs:
  ## The Servarr application instances, such as Sonarr or Radarr, whose download client
  ## items should be pruned.  At least one Servarr instance must be configured.
  ## Multiple Servarr instances may be given: e.g. prune download client items in both
  ## Sonarr and Radarr.
  Sonarr:
    url: "http://localhost:8989"
    api-key: ""
    type: "sonarr"
  Radarr:

download-clients:
  ## Support managing download clients without Servarr instances, use these URLs to
  ## connect to download clients instead of looking them up from Servarr settings.
  # urls:
  #   - "https://transmission:secret@transmission.example.com"
  ## Calculate an appropriate margin of disk space to keep free when deciding whether to
  ## prune download items based the maximum download bandwidth/speed in Mbps and the
  ## amount of time in seconds at that rate for which download clients should be able to
  ## continue downloading without exhausting disk space.
  ## 100 Mb/s, e.g. dedicated ethernet, default
  max-download-bandwidth: 100
  ## 60 seconds * 60 minutes = 1 hour, default
  # min-download-time-margin: 3600
  ## 60 seconds * 10 daemon poll margin = 10 minutes
  min-download-time-margin: 600
  ## Should the maximum download bandwidth/speed be set in the download client as a
  ## limit when resuming downloads after previously stopping?  May be useful for QoS to
  ## optimize real download throughput.
